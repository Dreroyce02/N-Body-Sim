N-Body-Sim

I really don't know what to put in this file but it seems important so I'll just say that I will probably added some way to easily input variables and and executable for easy running. If you have an idea then fork this baby and go right ahead just make sure to merge when your done. 

Seems there is a bug where some of the objects will have intermittent or no gravitaional interaction at all.
